# 字符集与字符编码

## 概念


[字符编码](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%97%E7%AC%A6%E7%BC%96%E7%A0%81)（英语：[Character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding)）、字集码是把字符集中的字符编码为指定集合中某一对象（例如：比特模式、自然数序列、8位组或者电脉冲），以便文本在计算机中存储和通过通信网络的传递。 

A character set is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages. Example: The Latin character set is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.

A coded character set is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number.

A coded character set (CCS) is a function that maps characters to code points (each code point represents one character). For example, in a given repertoire, the capital letter "A" in the Latin alphabet might be represented by the code point 65, the character "B" to 66, and so on. Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example ISO/IEC 8859-1 and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different code points.

[ASCII](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) 是对26个基本拉丁字母、阿拉伯数字和英式标点符号这些字符集的编码方式。
